Uses the following third-party components:

* [E-MSBuild](https://github.com/3F/E-MSBuild)

* [Varhead](https://github.com/3F/Varhead)

* [Json.NET](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json)
  Actually, only for this line: `((JArray)data).ToObject(typeof(object[]))`.
  This dependency is still being considered.
